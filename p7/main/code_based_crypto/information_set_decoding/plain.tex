Finally we can state our first information-set decoding algorithm.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Plain information-set decoding}\label{alg:plain_ISD}
\begin{algorithmic}
  \Procedure{Plain ISD}{$G$: a generator matrix of $[n,k]_q$ code $\mathcal{C}$, $y$: recived word, $t$: number of errors}
  \For{$I \in \Call{IS Generator}{G, false}$}
  \State $m' \gets y_IG_I^{-1}$
  \If{$\wt(y - m'G) \leq t$}
  \State \Return $m'$
  \EndIf
  \EndFor
  \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{proof}[Proof of the correctness of Algorithm \ref{alg:plain_ISD}]
  Suppose $y = m^TG + e^T$, where $m \in \mathbb{F}_q^{k}$ and $e \in \mathbb{F}_q^n$ such that $\wt(e) = t$ with  $t \leq \floor{\frac{d - 1}{2}}$, where $d$ is the minimum distance of the code generated by $G$. Assuming that the coordinates of $y_I$ are error free, then $m' := y_IG_I^{-1}$ equals $m$ and hence $\wt(y - m'G) = t$, and we return $m$. Otherwise if $y_I$ isn't error free, then $m' \neq m$, and hence $\wt(mG - m'G) \geq 2t$ as $\mathcal{C}$ has a minimum distance of at least $2t$, combining this with the fact that $y$ differs from $mG$ in exactly $t$ positions we see if $\wt(y - m'G) \leq t$, then we know that $m'$ equals $m$.
\end{proof}
Next we will briefly discuss the expected work factor of Algorithm \ref{alg:plain_ISD}. We will assume that the indicies non zero indicies of the error vector are distributed uniformly. The probability of choosing an information-set, which is error free, is $\binom{n - t}{k} \binom{n}{k}^{-1}$, after all we have $n - t$ error free positions and $\binom{n}{k}$ choices of $k$ indicies. In addition the basic matrix inversion algorithm has a time total work factor of about $\alpha k^3$ for some small $\alpha$. Hence the total expected work factor is about:
\begin{equation*}
  W = \alpha k^3 \binom{n}{k} \binom{n - t}{k}^{-1}
\end{equation*}
The $\binom{n}{k} \binom{n - t}{k}^{-1}$ comes from the fact, that we are computing the expected value of a stochastic variable which follows a geometric distribution with success probability of $\binom{n - t}{k} \binom{n}{k}^{-1}$.
