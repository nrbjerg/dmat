The following introduction of the McElice public key cryptosystem (abreviated McElice PKCS), is based upon \cite{r6}. Before we can introduce the McElice PKCS, we will need to introduce some basic concepts from error correcting codes.

\begin{definition}
  Let $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ be $[n, k]_{q}$ codes, with generator matrices $G_1$ and $G_2$ respectively then:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If there exists a permutation matrix $P \in  \mathbb{F}_{q}^{k \times k}$ such that $G_1 = G_{2}P$, then $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ are called \textit{permutation equivalent}.
    \item The codes $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ are called \textit{equivalent}, denoted $\mathcal{C}_1 \sim \mathcal{C}_{2}$, if there exists a matrix $S \in GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and permutation matrix $P \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n \times n}$ such that $G_1 = S G_2P$.
  \end{enumerate}
%  then if there exists a permutation matrix $P \in \mathbb{F}_q^{k \times k}$ and a non-singular matrix $S \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n \times n}$ such that $G_1 = SG_2P$, then $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ are called \textit{equivalent}, written $\mathcal{C}_1 \sim \mathcal{C}_{2}$. Additionally if there exits a permutation matrix $Q \in \mathbb{F}_{q}^{k \times k}$ such that $G_1 = QG_2$, then $\mathcal{C}_1$ is called \textit{permutation equivalent} to $\mathcal{C}_{2}$.
  %, then $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ are called \textit{permutation equivalent} if there exists a permutation matrix $P \in \mathbb{F}_q^{k \times k}$ such that $G_1 = G_{2}P$ alternatively if there exists a non-singular matrix $S \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n \times n}$ such that  $G_1 = SG_2P$ then $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ are called \textbf{equivalent}.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  The relation $\sim$, is indeed an equivalence relation:
  \begin{enumerate}
\item If $G$ is a generator matrix, then $G = G$ so $\sim$ is reflective.
\item Additionally if $G_1 = SG_2P$  then $S^{-1}G_1P^{-1} = G_2$ so $\sim$ is symmetric.
\item Finally, to show that $\sim$ is transitive, let $G_1 = S_1G_2P_1$ and $G_2 = S_2G_{3}P_2$. Then $G_1 = (S_1S_2)G_3(P_2P_1)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

Two equivalent codes, clearly share the same dimension, after all their generator matricies have the same number of rows. However it is not immediately obvious that they share the same minimum distance.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:equvilant_codes_share_parameters}
  Let $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ be equivalent $[n, k]_q$ codes, with generator matricies $G_1$ and $G_2$ respectively, such that $G_1 = SG_2P$, for some $S \in GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and permutation matrix $P \in \mathbb{F}_q^{k \times k}$: Then:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $H_2 \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n \times k}$ is a parity check matrix of $\mathcal{C}_2$ then the matrix $H_2 P$ is a parity check matrix of $\mathcal{C}_{1}$. \label{prop:equvilant_codes_share_parameters1}
    \item Additionally $d(\mathcal{C}_1) = d(\mathcal{C}_2)$. \label{prop:equvilant_codes_share_parameters2}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  We start by proving Assertion \ref{prop:equvilant_codes_share_parameters1}. We do this by showing that $(H_2P)G_1^T = 0_{k \times k}$ meaning $\mathcal{C}_1 \subseteq \Null(H_2P)$ and that $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_q}(\Null(H_2P)) = k$.
  The fact that $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_q}(\Null(H_2P)) = k$ follows from the fact that $P$ is a permutation matrix and hence:
  \begin{equation*}
    \dim_{\mathbb{F}_q}(\Null(H_2P)) = \dim_{\mathbb{F}_q}(\Null(H_{2})) \dim_{\mathbb{F}_q} (\mathcal{C_{2}}) = k
  \end{equation*}
  Next using the fact that $G_1 = SG_2P$ we see that:
  \begin{equation*}
    H_2PG_1^{T} = H_2P(P^TG_2^TS^T) \overset{(a)}{=} H_2G_2^TS^T \overset{(b)}{=} 0_{n \times n}
    % NOTE: har fjernet en (S^T)^{-1}
  \end{equation*}
  where equality $(a)$ follows as $P$ is a permutation matrix and hence orthogonal, and equality $(b)$ as $H_2G_{2}^{T} = 0_{n \times n}$.

  Continuing Assertion \ref{prop:equvilant_codes_share_parameters2} follows by combining Assertion \ref{prop:equvilant_codes_share_parameters1} with the fact that the minimum distance of a code with parity check matrix $H$, corresponds with the minimum number of linearly dependent columns of $H$. Finally we conclude the proof by noting that $H_2P$ has the same columns as $H_2$.
  %We note that $\mathcal{C}_1 \sim \mathcal{C}_2$ implies that there exists a $S \in GL_{n}(\mathbb{F}_{q})$ and a permutation matrix $P \in \mathbb{F}_q^{k \times k}$ such that $G_1 = SG_{2}P$. Hence as $S$ and $P$ are non-singular we know that $rank(G_1) = rank(G_{2})$.
  \label{}
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}\label{def:decoder}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a $[n, k, d]_{q}$ code and let $t \leq \floor{\frac{d - 1}{2}}$. A \textit{$t$-error correcting decoder} for $\mathcal{C}$ is a mapping $Dec_{\mathcal{C}}: \mathbb{F}_q^n \to \mathcal{C} \cup \left\{?\right\}$ which satisfies the condition that $Dec_{\mathcal{C}}(y) = c$ whenever $y = c + e$, with $c \in \mathcal{C}$ and $e \in \mathbb{F}_q^n$ such that $\wt(e) \leq t$, and $Dec_{\mathcal{C}}(y) = \; ?$ otherwise. An algorithm which implements a $t$-error correcting decoder for $\mathcal{C}$ is called a \textit{$t$-error correcting decoding algorithm} for $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  We often simply refer to the $t$-error correcting decoder $Dec_{\mathcal{C}}$ as a \textit{decoder} and any algorithm which implements a decoder for $\mathcal{C}$ as an \textit{decoding algorithm} for $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{remark}

%Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a $[n, k, d]_q$ code with generator matrix $G \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n \times k}$, such that we have an efficient algorithm $dec_{\mathcal{C}}$ for decoding codewords up to $t$ errors. Furthermore we let $S \in \mathbb{F}_q^{k \times k}$ be a random non-singular matrix and $P \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n \times n}$ be a random permutation matrix.
%The secret key will be the tripe $(Dec_{\mathcal{C}}, S, P)$ and the public key will be $G' = S \cdot G \cdot P$. To encrypt a $k$-length message $m$, we will compute $y = m G' + e$, such that $e \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n}$ is a random vector with $\wt(e) \leq t$. The decryption of the message is slightly more complicated, the algorithm is given in Algorithm \ref{alg:McElice_decrypt}.

We have now covered all of the necessary tools needed to introduce the McElice PKCS:
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $[n, k, d]_q$ code with generator matrix $G$ and an efficient $t$-error correcting decoding algorithm $Dec_{\mathcal{C}}$, furthermore let $S \in GL_{k \times k}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $P \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n \times n}$ be a random permutation matrix. An overview of the McElice PKCS is given below in Algorithm \ref{alg:McElice}.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{McElice PKC}\label{alg:McElice}
\begin{algorithmic}
  \State \textbf{private key} $(Dec_{\mathcal{C}}, S, P)$
  \State \textbf{public key} $(G' = S \cdot G \cdot P, t)$
  \\
  \Procedure{McElice Encryption} {$m$: plain message}
    \State $c \gets m^{T} G'$
    \State Choose $e \in \mathbb{F}_q^n$ uniformly, such that $\wt(e) = t$.
    \State \Return $c + e$
  \EndProcedure \\
  \Procedure{McElice Decryption} {$y$: received chipher-text}
    \State $y' \gets y P^{-1}$
    \State $m' \gets Dec_{\mathcal{C}}(y')$
    \State \Return $m' S^{-1}$
  \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:decryption_algorithm_produces_correct_message}
  Given some $y = m^{T}G' + e$, with $e \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n}$ such that $\wt(e) = t$, the decryption algorithm described in Algorithm \ref{alg:McElice} yiels the correct message $m^{T}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Sticking to the notation used in Algorithm \ref{alg:McElice} we have:
  \begin{equation*}
    y' := (m^{T} G' + e) P^{-1} = m^{T}SG + e P^{-1}
  \end{equation*}
  However as $P^{-1} = P^{T}$ is also permutation matrix, we see that $\wt(eP^{-1}) = t$. Hence we may apply our $t$-error correcting decoder $Dec_{\mathcal{C}}$ to $y'$ and get $m' := m^{T}S$ now multiplying $m'$ by $S^{-1}$ we obtain $m^{T}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  The matrix $G'$ will be the generator matrix of another $[n, k]_{q}$ code $\mathcal{C}'$. By Proposition \ref{prop:equvilant_codes_share_parameters} $d(\mathcal{C}') = d(\mathcal{C})$. Hence the decoding of $m^T G' + e$ also makes sense. In fact the decoding $m^T G' + e$ is one of the ways to attack the McElice PKCS. We will discuss this in more detail in Sections \ref{sec:syndrome_decoding} and \ref{sec:information_set_decoding}.
\end{remark}

We mentioned earlier that we would study public key cryptosystem which where bases on the general decoding problem, See Problem \ref{prob:general_decoding}. However the McElice PKCS is actually based on the following ``weaker'' problem, in the sense that an efficient algorithm for solving this problem doesn't necessarily yield an efficient solution to Problem \ref{prob:general_decoding}. However if $\mathbf{NP} = \mathbf{P}$, meaning that Problem \ref{prob:general_decoding} could be solved in polynomial time, then the McElice PKCS would be venerable to attack.
\begin{problem}[McElice Problem]\label{prob:McElice}
  Given $(G', t)$ and a ciphertext $y$ find the unique $m \in \mathbb{F}_q^{k}$ such that $\wt(m^{T}G' - c) = t$.
\end{problem}
The main difference between Problem \ref{prob:McElice} and Problem \ref{prob:general_decoding} is that we are provided with a basis of $\mathcal{C}'$ in Problem \ref{prob:McElice}, since we know $G'$. However the idea is to have as little structure of the underlying code revealed by $G'$ as possible, to make the problem closer to Problem \ref{prob:general_decoding}.

In general we have two kinds of attacks on the McElice PKCS
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Structural Attacks}: Where we try to extract information about the underlying code, using $G'$. If we obtain enough information we may be able to implement our own efficient $t$-error correcting decoding algorithm.
    \item \textit{Generic Attacks}: Where we try to construct efficient $t$-error correcting decoding algorithms given $(G', t)$, without concerning our selves with the underlying structure of $\mathcal{C}$, we will refer to such decoding algorithms as being \textit{generic}.
\end{enumerate}

Two of the main goals of this project is to investigate these attacks. Understanding of structural attacks allows us to gain insights into which families of codes constitutes ``good'' candidates for use in the McElice PKCS. While generic attacks allows us to measure the security of the McElice PKCS constructed on the codes resilient to structural attacks.
