# Notes

Hi Matteo,

I have done a bit of research on the possible topics that we discussed and i would like some guidance, one of the things i would like to focus on is doing some actual implementing the topics using a programming language (if possible and if time permits). 

Questions regarding the project:
1. I am a bit concerned about the scope & difficulty of the McElice-style cryptosystems, do you think it is feasable?
2. Do you have any suggestions for programming languages which can be used to implement this sort of stuff (I have heard of stuff like Magma & Sage, however i think i would like some practice in a more "mainstream" language, to get some experience for after the degree.)
3. 


Below you will see some notes on the two topics we discussed:

## Eliptic Curve Cryptosystems and Digital Signatures
To be fair i haven't researched this topic to the same degree as McElice Cryptosystems on AG codes

1. The discrete logarithm problem and some attacks.
2. The basic theory of elliptic curves over finite fields.
3. Eliptic curve cryptography and digital signatures.
   * Here i would also discuss hash functions.
4. Perhaps an appendix discussing Shoors algorithm, assuming time permits.

## McElice-style Cryptosystems based on AG Codes:
1. Algorithms for decoding and computing bases of the Riemann-Roch space of a divisor.
2. McEliece-style cryptosystems:
   * A general introduction including that the underlying problem is NP-complete, and some strengths and weaknesses (primarily keysize).
   * Perhaps some attacks systems constructed on pure AG codes.
3. An appendix on NP-completeness, note that this would simply be an informal discussion. (I am planing on taking a course on computational complexity next semester, so there is no point in doing to much research into the topic ;))

Thank you for taking the time.
