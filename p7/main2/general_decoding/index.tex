\chapter{Generic Decoding Algorithms}
In this chapter we study generic decoding algorithms (meaning they work for arbitrary codes), we study these algorithms as the provide generic attacks on the McElice public key cryptography scheme.
We will exclusively be working nearest neighbor decoding, meaning for a received message $y = c + e \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n}$, where $e \in \mathbb{F}_q^n$ is a random error vector and $c$ is a codeword in a $[n, k]_{q}$ code $\mathcal{C}$. We then estimate $c$ as $\hat{c} := \underset{c \in \mathcal{C}}{\arg \min} (d(c, y))$, equivalently we can estimate the error $e$ as $\hat{e} := \underset{e \in \mathbb{F}_q^n \\ y - e \in \mathcal{C}}{\arg \min} \wt(e)$, we will refer to both of these as nearest neighbor estimates.

%If we can find \textcolor{blue}{efficient} algorithm for solving the McElice problem, see Problem \ref{prob:McElice}, then we would have broken the McElice PKCS, hence we will focus on the cases where we know a generator matrix of the code.
