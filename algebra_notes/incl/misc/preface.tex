\chapter{Preface}

This is a Bachelor project written at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University.
As such, it's expected that the reader has taken courses in abstract algebra and linear algebra.
It is also expected of the reader is acquainted with the basics of topology. However no prior knowledge in algebraic geometry or error correcting codes is expected.

The work on the project took place from the 1. of February to the 25. of May 2023.

%Sources are given at the start of each section, and after the Harvard method, that is:\\
%The author's last name [year]

Definitions, propositions, theorems, lemmas, corollaries, and remarks are numbered according to each chapter and consecutively.
Equations are numbered separately and likewise with figures and tables.
Finally the endings of proofs and examples are marked with $\blacksquare$ and $\square$ respectively.

A table of notation and shorthands is given after the list of contents. 
Please note that some symbols may be used differently in different chapters.
