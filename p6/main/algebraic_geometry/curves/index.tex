\chapter{Algebraic Plane Curves}\label{sec:algebraic_curves}
In section \ref{sec:basics_of_algebraic_geometry} we introduced some basic concepts and results from algebraic geometry. Using this foundation we introduce and study the theory algebraic plane curves. We will focus on algebraic curves in the affine and projective plane, however most of the results generalise. (\textcolor{blue}{TODO} is this true?)
