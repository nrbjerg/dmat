\subsection{Algebraic Plane Curves}%
\label{subsec:plane_curves}
Moving forward we will focus on affine and projective curves in $\A^{2}(\cF_{q})$ and $\P^{2}(\cF_{q})$ respectively. We will start with some much needed examples, to illustrate some of the concepts introduced in the last subsection, we will often refer back to these examples, in the later parts of this section.
%\begin{example}\label{exmp:klein_curve}
%  Consider the polynomial $f = X^{m}Y + Y^{m}Z + Z^{m}X \in \cF_{q}[X, Y, Z]$, the $m$-klein curve is defined as
%  \begin{equation*}
%    \mathcal{K}_m := Z(f)
%  \end{equation*}
%\end{example}
