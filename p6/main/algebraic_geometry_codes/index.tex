\chapter{Algebraic Geometry Codes}\label{chap:alg_geom_codes}
The following chapter is based on \cite{CCC_with_CA}[Section 11.2] and \cite{notes_on_alg_geom_codes}[Chapter 4].
We introduce the codes constructed on curves, we will introduce some new notation. An affine or projective curve $\mathcal{X}$ with defining equation $F = 0$ is said to be a curve over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ if $F \in \mathbb{F}_{q}[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{n}]$ is absolutely irreducible. Furthermore, if $\mathcal{X}$ is an affine or projective curve over $\F_{q}$ then we will let $I(\mathcal{X})$ by the ideal consisting of all polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_{q}[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{n}]$ which vanish on $\mathcal{X}$. This ideal is prime both in $\mathbb{F}_{q}[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{n}]$ but also in $\cF_{q}[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{n}]$, since $F$ being absolutely irreducible implies that $F$ is prime in $\mathbb{F}[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{n}]$ and $\cF_{q}[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{n}]$. The coordinate ring $\mathbb{F}[\mathcal{X}]$ is defined as $\mathbb{F}_{q}[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{n}] / I(\mathcal{X})$, and the function field $\mathbb{F}(\mathcal{X})$ is defined as the quotient field of $\mathbb{F}_{q}[\mathcal{X}]$.\footnote{Notice that it is a subring and field respectively of the usual coordinate ring and function field of $\mathcal{X}$.}

Recall the Frobenius map $\F_{q} \ni x \mapsto x^{q} \in \F_{q}$. The \textit{extended Frobenius map} $\psi$ is simply the Frobenius map extended coordinate wise, to either the $n$ dimensional affine or projective space. We notice that $G(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n})^{q} = G(x_1^{q}, x_2^{q}, \ldots, x_{n}^{q})$ for all $G \in \mathbb{F}_{q}[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{n}]$ and $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n} \in \mathbb{F}_{q}$ by freshman's dream. Hence, if $\mathcal{X}$ is an affine or projective curve defined over $\F_{q}$ then $P \in \mathcal{X}$, implies $\psi(P) \in \mathcal{X}$.

A divisor $D \in Div(\mathcal{X})$ is called rational if the weight of $P$ and $\psi(P)$ is the same for all $P \in \mathcal{X}$. The vector space $L(D)$ will only consist of rational divisors and is otherwise defined as before, albeit with the restriction of the rational functions to $\mathbb{F}_{q}(\mathcal{X})$. However, even with these changes the Reimann Roch Theorem \ref{thm:reimann_roch} remains true, confer both of the sources listed earlier.

Finally, let $\mathcal{P} := (P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_{m})$ be a tuple of points, then we define the \textit{evaluation map} as in Example \ref{exmp:rs_codes} to be the map as $\ev(F) = (F(P_1), F(P_2), \ldots, F(P_{m}))$. The domain of $\ev$ will either be a subset of $\F_{q}(\mathcal{X}) \setminus \left\{0\right\}$ or $\F_{q}[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{n}]$.
