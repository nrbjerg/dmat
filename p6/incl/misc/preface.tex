\chapter{Preface}

This is a Bachelor project written at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University.
As such, it is expected that the reader has taken courses in abstract algebra and linear algebra.
It is also expected that the reader is acquainted with the basics of topology. However, no prior knowledge in algebraic geometry or error correcting codes is required.

The work on the project took place from the 1. of February to the 25. of May 2023.

Sources are stated at the start of each chapter / section, using the Harvard method, that is: Last name of the author(s) [year of publication].

Definitions, propositions, theorems, lemmas, corollaries, and remarks are numbered according to each chapter and consecutively.
Equations are numbered separately and likewise with figures and tables.
The conclusions of proofs and examples are marked with $\blacksquare$ and $\square$ respectively.

A table of notation and shorthands is given after the list of contents.
Please note that some symbols may be used differently in different chapters.

Finally, I wish to thank and acknowledge my supervisor Matteo Bonini for his guidance and for being indulgent enough, to answer questions with no imitate application to the project.
