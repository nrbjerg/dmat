In this bachelors project we study the theory of algebraic geometry codes, these
are linear error correcting codes constructed using the theory of algebraic geometry and in particular the theory of algebraic curves.
Using the Reimann Roch Theorem we show that there exists good lower bounds on the parameters of these codes.
Finally, we discuss the asymptotic properties of these codes and in particular how one can construct algebraic geometry codes which execed the asymptotic Giblert-Varshamov bound.
